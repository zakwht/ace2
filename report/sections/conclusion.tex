\section{Conclusion}

There have been consistent results in identifying influential residues in ACE2 in former studies (\textcitecomma{Liu}; \textcitecomma{LiQin}): mutations positions 31, 41, 82-84, 353, 355, and 357 are known to abolish interaction with the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. This computational analysis successfully identified five of these established positions by comparing amino acid sequences known to be susceptible to the virus with those that are not.
