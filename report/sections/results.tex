\section{Results}

% 149 total indices, 181
The analysis identified 181 total mutations in 149 different sites, and isolated the eight most influential (see Table 2). Each mutation appeared in at least two sequences, and all but one sequence included one of the mutations; the domestic pig sequence did not contain any of the resulting influential mutations. Table 3 shows the residues at the identified positions for each insusceptible sequence, emphasizing the influential mutations.

Five of these selected mutations corresponded to findings in previous studies: \textcite{Li} found that mutations D31, F83, and H353 abolished the interaction with the spike protein and mutation A41 inhibited it; \textcite{Lee} found that the Lysine at 31, Tyrosine at 83, and Proline at 426 that appear in human sequences were each crucial residues for susceptibility.

There are no published studies suggesting the remaining three mutations (A66, N113, V679) have any effect on the protein's interaction with the spike protein. Similarly, the UniProt entry for the ACE2 protein does not include any reference to the acids at these positions impacting the degree of interaction \cite{UniProt}.
