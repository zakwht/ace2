\section*{Acknowledgments}

I'd like to thank Dr. Hosna Jabbari, who, with the help of TA Alison Ziesel, instructed a computation biology course that offered an interesting introduction to concepts in biology, and provided insight into the intersection between the fields of biology and computer science.

I'd also like to thank Samantha Addison Mitchell, who let me pick her brain as I worked through this project and learned new concepts.
