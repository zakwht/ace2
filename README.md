### Abstract
SARS-CoV-2 is an contagious virus established to affect not only humans, but other mammal species. Studies over the last two years have revealed certain species are distinctly immune to the virus, a reality this report aims to understand. By analyzing the differences between sequences of the virus’ target protein, ACE2, in hosts with varying susceptibility to the virus, this study investigates mutations that may impact a host’s vulnerability. 

The analysis identifies eight mutations that may influence susceptibility (D31, A41, A66, F83, N113, H353, S426, V679), five of which are referenced in other studies.
